The Smart Classroom project is a modular, extensible framework designed to process and summarize
educational content using advanced AI models. It supports transcription, summarization, and
future capabilities like video understanding and real-time analysis.

This application provides an end-to-end workflow, starting from file uploads or live recording,
through audio analysis and video streaming, to generate insightful outputs like mind maps and
class statistics. You can monitor system performance, switch between audio-video modes, and
validate results seamlessly, ensuring an interactive and efficient classroom experience.

The main features are as follows:

- **Audio file processing and transcription** with ASR models (e.g., Whisper, Paraformer)
- **Summarization** using powerful LLMs (e.g., Qwen, LLaMA)
- **Plug-and-play architecture** for integrating new ASR and LLM models
- **API-first design** ready for frontend integration
- Ready-to-extend for real-time streaming, diarization, translation, and video analysis
