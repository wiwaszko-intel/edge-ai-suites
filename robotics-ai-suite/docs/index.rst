Robotics AI Suite
###################

.. attention:: Robotics AI Suite is currently a preview release! A formal release will follow shortly.

The Robotics AI Suite provides a collection of robotics applications spanning AI, libraries, samples, benchmarking, and more to help developers quickly build solutions.

Based on your needs, you can install one, two, or all of the following kits and framework at the same time. While they are not prerequisites to each other, they complement each other:

- Autonomous Mobile Robot: This kit provides tools that help you develop, train, and deploy AI models, for example, recognizing text on boxes and deciding what to do with them, based on the text.

- Robot Vision & Control Framework: This framework enables robots to see and act physically based on what they see in their environment, for example, picking up boxes with the right text.

- Humanoid - Imitation Learning: This kit enables robots to learn and improve their performance over time, for example, picking up boxes more efficiently over time, even with physical obstacles.
