.. note::
   | When deploying Robotics AI Suite with ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04 systems running kernel version 6.8 or lower, GPU/NPU offload functionality for Intel® Core™ Ultra processors (Series 2) is not fully supported. In these environments, only CPU-based examples should be used.

.. note::

   | Intel does not recommend running simulations, like Gazebo*, on a physical robot.
