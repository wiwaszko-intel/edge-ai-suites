Follow-me with ADBSCAN on iRobot Create 3
================================================

This tutorial provides instructions for running the ADBSCAN-based Follow-me algorithm from Autonomous Mobile Robot using Intel® RealSense™ camera input.
Validation of the the algorithm was performed on a custom iRobot Create 3.
The Intel® RealSense™ camera publishes to ``/camera/depth/color/points`` topic. The `adbscan_sub_node` subscribes to the corresponding topic,
detects the obstacle array, computes the robot's velocity and publishes to the ``/cmd_vel`` topic of type `geometry_msg/msg/Twist`.
This ``twist`` message consists of the updated angular and linear velocity of the robot to follow the target, which can be subsequently subscribed by a robot-driver.


Getting Started
-------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Assemble your robotic kit following the instructions :doc:`irobot-create3 <../../../developer_kit/irobot-create3-robot>`

- Complete the :doc:`../../../../../gsg_robot/index` before continuing.

Intel® board connected to iRobot Create 3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the instructions on page
`iRobot® Create® 3 - Network Recommendations
<https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/setup/network-config/>`__
to set up an Ethernet over USB connection and to configure the network
device on the Intel® board.
Use an IP address of the same subnet as used on the iRobot Create 3.

Check that the iRobot Create 3 is reachable over the Ethernet
connection. Output on the robot with the configuration from the image
above:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ping -c 3 192.168.99.2

   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.989/2.105/2.308/0.144 ms

Install the Deb package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the ``ros-humble-follow-me-tutorial`` Deb package from the Intel® Autonomous Mobile Robot APT repository.

   .. code-block::

      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install ros-humble-follow-me-tutorial

Run Demo
----------------

To launch the Follow-me application tutorial on the iRobot Create 3 robot, use the following ROS 2 launch file.

   .. code-block::

      source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
      ros2 launch tutorial_follow_me irobot_followme_launch.py

After executing the above command, you can observe that the robot detecting the target within a tracking radius
(~0.5 - 1.5 m; `min_dist` and `max_dist` are set in `/opt/ros/humble/share/tutorial_follow_me/params/followme_adbscan_RS_params.yaml`)
and subsequently following the moving target person.

.. note::

   There are reconfigurable parameters in `/opt/ros/humble/share/tutorial_follow_me/params/followme_adbscan_RS_params.yaml`
   file. The user can modify the parameters depending on the respective robot, sensor configuration and environments (if required) before running the tutorial.
   Find a brief description of the parameters in the following table.

   .. list-table:: Configurable Parameters
      :widths: 20 80

      * - ``Lidar_type``
        - Type of the point cloud sensor. For Intel® RealSense™ camera and LIDAR inputs, the default value is set to ``RS`` and ``2D``, respectively.
      * - ``Lidar_topic``
        - Name of the topic publishing point cloud data.
      * - ``Verbose``
        - If this flag is set to ``True``, the locations of the detected target objects will be printed as the screen log.
      * - ``subsample_ratio``
        - This is the downsampling rate of the original point cloud data. Default value = 15 (i.e. every 15-th data in the original point cloud is sampled and passed to the core ADBSCAN algorithm).
      * - ``x_filter_back``
        - Point cloud data with x-coordinate > ``x_filter_back`` are filtered out (positive x direction lies in front of the robot).
      * - ``y_filter_left``, ``y_filter_right``
        - Point cloud data with y-coordinate > ``y_filter_left`` and y-coordinate < ``y_filter_right`` are filtered out (positive y-direction is to the left of robot and vice versa).
      * - ``z_filter``
        - Point cloud data with z-coordinate < ``z_filter`` will be filtered out. This option will be ignored in case of 2D Lidar.
      * - ``Z_based_ground_removal``
        - Filtering in the z-direction will be applied only if this value is non-zero. This option will be ignored in case of 2D Lidar.
      * - ``base``, ``coeff_1``, ``coeff_2``, ``scale_factor``
        - These are the coefficients used to calculate adaptive parameters of the ADBSCAN algorithm. These values are pre-computed and recommended to keep unchanged.
      * - ``init_tgt_loc``
        - This value describes the initial target location. The person needs to be at a distance of ``init_tgt_loc`` in front of the robot to initiate the motor.
      * - ``max_dist``
        - This is the maximum distance that the robot can follow. If the person moves at a distance > ``max_dist``, the robot will stop following.
      * - ``min_dist``
        - This value describes the safe distance the robot will always maintain with the target person. If the person moves closer than ``min_dist``, the robot stops following.
      * - ``max_linear``
        - Maximum linear velocity of the robot.
      * - ``max_angular``
        - Maximum angular velocity of the robot.
      * - ``max_frame_blocked``
        - The robot will keep following the target for ``max_frame_blocked`` number of frames in the event of a temporary occlusion.
      * - ``tracking_radius``
        - The robot will keep following the target as long as the current target location = previous location +/- ``tracking_radius``

Troubleshooting
----------------------------

- Failed to install Deb package: Please make sure to run ``sudo apt update`` before installing the necessary Deb packages.

- You may stop the demo anytime by pressing ``ctrl-C``.

- If the robot rotates more than intended at each step, try reducing the parameter ``max_angular`` in the parameter file.

- For general robot issues, go to: :doc:`../../../../../dev_guide/tutorials_amr/robot-tutorials-troubleshooting`.

- If the motor controller board does not start, restart the robot.
