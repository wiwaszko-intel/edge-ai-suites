AAEON Robotic Kits
##################

The AAEON UP Xtreme* i11 & UP Squared* 6000 Robotic Development Kits are delivered with the Intel® Edge Insights for Autonomous Mobile Robots software preinstalled.
This is a legacy version of the Autonomous Mobile Robot. The devices may give you a good start to get familiar with an autonomous robotic system.
To get detailed information on the hardware of these robotic kits,
check out the up-board.org page:
`UP Xtreme i11 & UP Squared 6000 Robotic Development Kits <https://up-board.org/up-xtreme-i11-up-squared-6000-robotic-development-kits>`__.


Using the AAEON kit with the latest Autonomous Mobile Robot
-------------------------------------------------------------

After you have created a back-up of the legacy software on the robotic kit
and verified that the robot is functioning properly,
you are free to start over with a fresh OS installation to set up the robot system
with the latest Autonomous Mobile Robot release.
Just follow our :doc:`../../../gsg_robot/index` from installation of Ubuntu, ROS software to the Autonomous Mobile Robot.
Since release 2.0 the new Deb package based SDK contains all the software required to run on an AAEON robotic kit. It also includes a number of additional tutorials.
