Robot Kits
======================

To run our tutorials on a real robot, you can use your own robot with ROS 2 support. The chapter :doc:`create-your-robot-kit` will provide you information on how start using it with the Autonomous Mobile Robot.

For convenience, you can also use a robotic kit that supports the ROS 2 operating system and add the Autonomous Mobile Robot to it by following the :doc:`../../../gsg_robot/index`.

Check out the :doc:`clearpath-jackal-robot` tutorial to see how we applied the Autonomous Mobile Robot to the Jackal robot.

You can also have a look at the :doc:`AAEON a robotic kit <legacy-aaeon-developer-kit>`, which comes with a preinstalled "Edge Insights for Autonomous Mobile Robots" software (the legacy version of the Autonomous Mobile Robot) and is used in many of the Autonomous Mobile Robot tutorials.
