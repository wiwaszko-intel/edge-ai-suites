# Get Started

-   **Time to Complete:** 30 minutes
-   **Programming Language:**  Python 3

## Prerequisites

- [System Requirements](system-requirements.md)

## Setup the application

The following instructions assume Docker engine is correctly set up in the host system.
If not, follow the [installation guide for docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

1. Clone the **edge-ai-suites** repository and change into industrial-edge-insights-vision directory. The directory contains the utility scripts required in the instructions that follows.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
    cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/
    ```

2.  Set app specific environment variable file:

    ```bash
    cp .env_pcb_anomaly_detection .env
    ```

3.  Edit the below mentioned environment variables in the `.env` file as follows:

    ```bash
    HOST_IP=<HOST_IP>   # IP address of server where DLStreamer Pipeline Server is running.

    MR_PSQL_PASSWORD=  #PostgreSQL service & client adapter e.g. intel1234

    MR_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=   # MinIO service & client access key e.g. intel1234
    MR_MINIO_SECRET_KEY=   # MinIO service & client secret key e.g. intel1234

    MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_USERNAME=<username>  # WebRTC credentials e.g. intel1234
    MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_PASSWORD=<password>

    # application directory
    SAMPLE_APP=pcb-anomaly-detection
    ```

4.  Install the pre-requisites. Run with sudo if needed.

    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

    This script sets up application pre-requisites, downloads artifacts, sets executable permissions for scripts etc. Downloaded resource directories are made available to the application via volume mounting in docker compose file automatically.

## Deploy the Application

5.  Start the Docker application:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

6.  Fetch the list of pipeline loaded available to launch:

    ```bash
    ./sample_list.sh
    ```

    This lists the pipeline loaded in DL Streamer Pipeline Server.

    Example Output:

    ```bash
    # Example output for PCB Anomaly Detection
    Environment variables loaded from [WORKDIR]/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/.env
    Running sample app: pcb-anomaly-detection
    Checking status of dlstreamer-pipeline-server...
    Server reachable. HTTP Status Code: 200
    Loaded pipelines:
    [
        ...
        {
            "description": "DL Streamer Pipeline Server pipeline",
            "name": "user_defined_pipelines",
            "parameters": {
            "properties": {
                "classification-properties": {
                    "element": {
                        "format": "element-properties",
                        "name": "classification"
                    }
                }
            },
            "type": "object"
            },
            "type": "GStreamer",
            "version": "pcb_anomaly_detection"
        }
        ...
    ]
    ```

7.  Start the sample application with a pipeline.

    ```bash
    ./sample_start.sh -p pcb_anomaly_detection
    ```

    This command will look for the payload for the pipeline specified in the `-p` argument above, inside the `payload.json` file and launch a pipeline instance in DLStreamer Pipeline Server. Refer to the table, to learn about different available options.

    > **IMPORTANT**: Before you run `sample_start.sh` script, make sure that
    > `jq` is installed on your system. See the
    > [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting-guide.md#unable-to-parse-json-payload-due-to-missing-jq-package)
    > for more details.

    Output:

    ```bash
    # Example output for PCB Anomaly Detection
    Environment variables loaded from [WORKDIR]/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/.env
    Running sample app: pcb-anomaly-detection
    Checking status of dlstreamer-pipeline-server...
    Server reachable. HTTP Status Code: 200

    ```

    > **NOTE:** This will start the pipeline. The inference stream can be viewed on WebRTC, in a browser at the following url:

    ```bash
    https://<HOST_IP>/mediamtx/anomaly/
    ```

8.  Get the status of running pipeline instance(s).

    ```bash
    ./sample_status.sh
    ```

    This command lists status of pipeline instances launched during the lifetime of sample application.

    Output:

    ```bash
    # Example output for PCB Anomaly Detection
    Environment variables loaded from [WORKDIR]/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/.env
    Running sample app: pcb-anomaly-detection
    [
    {
        "avg_fps": 24.123323428597942,
        "elapsed_time": 9.865960359573364,
        "id": "f0c0b5aa5d4911f0bca7023bb629a486",
        "message": "",
        "start_time": 1752123260.5558383,
        "state": "RUNNING"
    }
    ]
    ```

9.  Stop pipeline instances.

    ```bash
    ./sample_stop.sh
    ```

    This command will stop all instances that are currently in the `RUNNING` state and return their last status.

    Output:

    ```bash
    # Example output for PCB Anomaly Detection
    No pipelines specified. Stopping all pipeline instances
    Environment variables loaded from [WORKDIR]/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/.env
    Running sample app: pcb-anomaly-detection
    Checking status of dlstreamer-pipeline-server...
    Server reachable. HTTP Status Code: 200
    Instance list fetched successfully. HTTP Status Code: 200
    Found 1 running pipeline instances.
    Stopping pipeline instance with ID: f0c0b5aa5d4911f0bca7023bb629a486
    Pipeline instance with ID 'f0c0b5aa5d4911f0bca7023bb629a486' stopped successfully. Response: {
        "avg_fps": 26.487679514091333,
        "elapsed_time": 25.634552478790283,
        "id": "f0c0b5aa5d4911f0bca7023bb629a486",
        "message": "",
        "start_time": 1752123260.5558383,
        "state": "RUNNING"
    }
    ```

   To stop a specific instance, identify it with the `--id` argument.
    For example, `./sample_stop.sh --id f0c0b5aa5d4911f0bca7023bb629a486`

10. Stop the Docker application:

    ```bash
    docker compose down -v
    ```

    This will bring down the services in the application and remove any volumes.
