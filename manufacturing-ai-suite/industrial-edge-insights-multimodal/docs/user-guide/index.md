# Industrial Edge Insights - Multimodal

MultiModal sample apps demonstrate how to use AI at the edge to identify defects in manufacturing environments by analyzing both image and time series sensor data.

In industrial quality is critical for safety and reliability. Manual inspections are time-consuming and prone to human error. Our solutions leverage deep learning models to automate defect detection, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Key features include:

- Multi-modal data fusion: Combines visual inspection (images) and sensor data (such as current, voltage, and temperature)
  for comprehensive defect detection.
- Real-time inference: Processes data at the edge for immediate feedback and reduced latency.
- Configurable alerts: Notifies operators of detected defects to enable timely intervention.
- Extensible pipeline: Supports integration with additional data sources and models.

Applications such as [Weld Defect Detection](./weld-defect-detection/Overview.md) help manufacturers enhance product quality, reduce inspection time, and minimize costly rework by enabling proactive defect detection on the factory floor.
